# The Cult of *DONE*
1. There are three stages of being.
    a. Not Knowing
    b. Action
    c. Completion
2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps get it *done*.
3. There is no editing stage.
4. Pretending you know what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you're doing even if you dont't and do it.
5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea *done*, abandon it.
6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things *done*.
7. Once you're *done* you can throw it away.
8. Laugh at perfection. It's boring and keeps you from being *done*.
9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes your right.
10. Failure counts as *done*. So do mistakes.
11. Destruction is a variant of *done*.
12. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of *done*.
13. *done* is the engine of more.
