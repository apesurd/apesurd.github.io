excerpt: My 2-cents on navigating the salary negotiation process 
---

As an introvert, discussing money often seems like a cardinal sin.
"You greedy asshat, you always want more money".
It makes me uncomfortable to discuss money, but with time I have come to realize that it is a necessary aspect to survive in the capitalistic world.
While internalizing this fact eases the discomfort, it never fully disappears.

What works for me is to be aware that it needs to be done, if I don't ask I won't get. At the end of the day, when you are working for a business, they would want to get the work done in as little money as possible. 
So I need to be prepared to negotiate to get the best deal possible.

On a very high level, if visualised through the venn diagram, the compensation I can get lies in the intersection of my expectations and the budget of the employer. In this intersection I would want to maximize my compensation.

Here are a couple of pointers that I have found useful for myself. Some of these would sound really obvious, but obvious stuff changes depending on the situation we are in. So it helps to have them written in the mind's whiteboard.
## The budget of the role
The budget of the role that you are applying for is determined by the following factors:
1. The skill set and experience required for the role.
2. Supply of the talent suitable for the role. Higher the supply, lower the pay.
3. The location of the role
4. Employers' propensity to pay for the role. Is it a startup? Is it a big company? How essential the role is for the employer?
5. Pay parity with the team mates.

### How to know the budget
1. Checkout websites like glassdoor, etc. to get an idea of the pay range for the role in the company. Checkout statistics from studies. 
2. Checkout the job description of the role, across different job boards. Some boards make it mandatory for employers to put the salary compensation. Also check what other employers are paying for the similar roles.
3. Check with the recruiter about the budget of the role. 1 out of 4 times the recruiter will tell you the budget.
4. Check with the existing team-member or ex team-members about the budget of the role. This has hardly worked out for me, but you may never know if you never ask. THINK: What's the worst that can happen?

Let me know if you have any other tips, that can help.

## Your expectations
You can set your expectations considering the following factors:
1. Ideally you would want to to be paid more than your expenses.
2. If you are applying for the similar role that you have experience working in, then you would want to be paid more than your previous salary.
3. If you are starting afresh in a profile that you don't have experience in, consider checking out the market value of the role for a fresher. That is the lowest you would go.
4. If you have offers from other employer, then use that offer amount as benchmark 


Your previous salary might not be great benchmark, if the role that you are applying for doesn't require the same skill set. But if the gap between the market value for the fresher role and your previous salary is substantial, then reconsider it based on your financial situation, and goals.  

Considering all the above points, reach a number that wouldn't go below, and add a premium to it. The premium would be based on the market conditions.
Let's call it min-expectation.


## Answering the salary requirement question
Ideally you won't apply for a role if the role is not able to pay you more than your min-expectation.

Once you are on the negotiation table, you need to prepared with your homework.
Here are some best practices: 
1. Try delaying the question: Say you need more information before you can provide a salary expectation is reasonable, if you are just getting started with the interview process. But eventually, you would need to discuss salary, and in case you have clarity about your expectatoin, I would suggest talk candidly about it. That way if the employer can't afford it, then you can rule it out. 
2. Provide a salary range: Instead of giving one specific number, give a range you are comfortable with. Make sure your target number is close to the bottom figure you provide, because the employer will likely opt for something on the lower end of your range.
3. Get salary requirement first: Say something along the lines of "Can you share the range for the role? Depending on the scope of the role and responsibility I would be able to tell what I have in mind." This has worked for me about 1 out of 5 times. Hopefully they won't say that 'I just need a number', or 'this is not how it works', etc. But you would never know if you don't try it out. Sometimes they are candid, and sometimes they are not.
4. Other negotiation options: Salary is just one piece of compensation puzzle, let them know that you need to hear more about the overall package, including benefits, variable pay, vacation, and other perks. 
    Script: "I am seeking a position that pays between X and Y annually, but I am open to negotiating salary depending on benefits, bonuses, equity, stock options, and other opportunities."
5. End of the process: Now you are at the end of the interview process, and it's time to settle on a number, and you may find that the initial range you provided is too low. If that's the case, begin your response by conveying your excitement about the position, summarizing the responsibilities, and what you will bring to the table.
Script: "I am really excited by this opportunity! I respect the range already discussed, but after hearing about the scope of responsibilities and considering my X years of experience in a similar role, I think X+ is a fair figure. I'm confident my years doing Y have equipped my well to succeed in the position."


Don't worry that they will retract the offer simply because you advocate what you're worth, unless you are not waving red-flags. They have already dedicated resources to vetting and interviewing; they're  not going to pull the plug simply because you negotiate your salary.
Employers usually expect you to negotiate your salary, but do it respectfully and with a reasonable basis.
