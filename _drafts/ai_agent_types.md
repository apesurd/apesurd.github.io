In this post I am exploring the AI-Agent types, categorized on the basis of their use-case.

I would be covering the four major types, i.e. Learning Agents, Reflex Agents, Goal-based Agents, and Utility-based Agents.
Note: This category is not exhaustive, and may be updated in the future.

## Learning Agents
Learning agents get better over time by learning from their own experiences. 
They have mechanisms in place to adapt and improve based on the feedback from their environment.

e.g. Recommendation Agents who in the beginning suggest a product to the user, but later on get better at giving the right recommendation based on the user's past interactions with the product.
#todo check if this is the industry standard. Wouldn't this be expected from all the agents?

## Reflex Agents
Reflex agents are agents that act immediately in response to the environment, without thinking about the past or present, based on a pre-determined set of rules or heuristics.
Like a light switch, simple cause and effect. 

e.g. Think of thermostat. If the room gets cold, turn on the heater. If the room gets warm, turn off the heater. It doesn't need to remember yesterday's temparature, or try to predict what the temperature would be tomorrow.

## Goal-based Agents
Instead of directly reacting, these agents plan first. They make decisions by considering how each action will bring them closer to achieving a specific goal. 

e.g. A robot that wants to pick up an object. If the object is in front of it, it will pick it up. If it is not in front of it, it will turn and walk towards the object.

## Utility-based Agents
These agents take it one step further. They don't just aim to achieve goals, but aim to achieve the goal in an optimized manner. They evaluate different paths, and associated outcomes to maximize the expected utility.

e.g. Consider financial trading bots. Instead of buying and selling stocks randomly, they would try to buy and sell stocks in a way that maximizes the expected profit, while minimizing the risk.
