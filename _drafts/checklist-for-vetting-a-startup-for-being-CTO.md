- Clickable UI mockups
- Core user flows
- Basic branding

2. Customer Validation Sprint (2-3 weeks)
- 20+ user interviews
- Market sizing 
- Competitor analysis
- Revenue projections

3. Find technical co-founder with proof
- Validated prototype
- User feedback data
- Revenue model
- Clear technical scope

Equity Recommendation
If you’ve done the work listed (prototyping, validation, and planning), consider negotiating 35-45% equity for the technical co-founder rather than 50%.

However, 50% may still be fair if:

The product is highly complex and demands extensive development.

The technical co-founder is also taking on operational or strategic roles.

The project requires significant long-term technical investment.

Equity decisions should ultimately reflect the value of each person’s contributions and align incentives for the company’s success.
